 TLS Authentication using IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI TS 103 097 certificates
                     draft-tls-certieee1609-01.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies the use of two new certificate types to
   authenticate TLS entities.  The first type enables the use of a
   certificate specified by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
   Engineers (IEEE) [IEEE1609.2] and the second by the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [TS103097].

1.  Introduction

   TLS protocol [RFC8446] [RFC5246] uses X509 and Raw Public Key in
   order to authenticate servers and clients.  This document describes
   the use of certificates specified either by the Institute of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) [IEEE1609.2] or the
   European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [TS103097].
   It is worth to mention that ETSI TS 103097certificate is a profile of
   IEEE 1609.2 certificate and it has the same data structure.  These
   standards are defined in order to secure communications in vehicular
   environments.  Existing authentication methods, such as X509 and Raw
   Public Key, are designed for Internet use, particularly for
   flexibility and extensibility, and are not optimized for bandwidth
   and processing time to support delay-sensitive applications.  This is
   why size-optimized certificates are defined and standardized to
   secure data exchange in highly dynamic vehicular environment in
   Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).

   Two new values referring the previously mentioned certificates will
   be added to the "client_certificate_type" and the
   "server_certificate_type" extensions defined in [RFC7250].

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Extension Overview

   To extend Client Hello and Server Hello messages, the
   "extension_data" field of the ClientCertTypeExtension and the 
   ServerCertTypeExtension structures defined in RFC7250 is used. 
   In order to negotiate the support of IEEE 1609.2 or ETSI TS 
   103097 certificate-based authentication, the clients and the 
   servers MAY include the extension of type "client_certificate_type" 
   and "server_certificate_type" in the extended Client Hello and 
   "EncryptedExtensions".  The "extension_data" field of this 
   extension SHALL contain a list of supported certificate types 
   proposed by the client as provided in figure below:


     /* Managed by IANA */
      enum {
          X509(0),
          RawPublicKey(2),
          1609Dot2(?), /* Number 3 will be requested for 1609.2 */
          (255)
      } CertificateType;

      struct {
          select (certificate_type) {

              /* certificate type defined in this document.*/
               case 1609Dot2:
               opaque cert_data<1..2^24-1>;

               /* RawPublicKey defined in RFC 7250*/
              case RawPublicKey:
              opaque ASN.1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>;

              /* X.509 certificate defined in RFC 5246*/
              case X.509:
              opaque cert_data<1..2^24-1>;

               };

             Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
         } CertificateEntry;

Internet-Draft   IEEE and ETSI Certificate Types for TLS  September 2018


   In case where TLS server accepts the described extension, it selects
   one of the certificate types in the extension described below.  Note
   that a server MAY authenticate the client using other authentication
   methods.

   The end-entity certificate's public key has to be compatible with one
   of the certificate types listed in the extension described above.

   It is worth to mention that the TLS client or server public keys are
   obtained from a certificate chain from a web page.

4.  TLS Client and Server Handshake

   The "client_certificate_type" and "server_certificate_type"
   extensions MUST be sent in handshake phase as illustrated in Figure 1
   below.  The reply of the server MUST be sent in EncryptedExtensions
   for TLS 1.3.  The same extension shall be sent in Server Hello for
   TLS 1.2.

4.1.  Client Hello

   In order to indicate the support of IEEE 1609.2 or ETSI TS 103097
   certificates, client MUST include an extension of type
   "client_certificate_type" and "server_certificate_type" in the
   extended Client Hello message.  The Hello extension is described in
   Section 4.1.2 of TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].

Internet-Draft   IEEE and ETSI Certificate Types for TLS  September 2018


   The extension 'client_certificate_type' sent in the Client Hello MAY
   carry a list of supported certificate types, sorted by client
   preference.  It is a list in the case where the client supports
   multiple certificate types.

   Client MAY respond along with supported certificates by sending a
   "Certificate" message immediately followed by the "CetificateVerify"
   message.  These specifications are valid for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.

   All implementations SHOULD be prepared to handle extraneous
   certificates and arbitrary orderings from any TLS version, with the
   exception of the end-entity certificate which MUST be first.

4.2.  Server Hello

   When the server receives the Client Hello containing the
   client_certificate_type extension and/or the server_certificate_type
   extension, the following options are possible:

      - The server supports the extension described in this document.
      It selects a certificate type from the client_certificate_type
      field in the extended Client Hello and must take into account the
      client authentication list priority.

      - The server does not support the proposed certificate type and
      terminates the session with a fatal alert of type
      "unsupported_certificate".

      - The server does not support the extension defined in this
      document.  In this case, the server returns the server hello
      without the extensions defined in this document in case of TLS
      1.2.

      - The server supports the extension defined in this document, but
      it does not have any certificate type in common with the client.
      Then, the server terminates the session with a fatal alert of type
      "unsupported_certificate".

      - The server supports the extensions defined in this document and
      has at least one certificate type in common with the client.  In
      this case, the server MUST include the client_certificate_type
      extension in the Server Hello for TLS 1.2 and in Encrypted
      Extension for TLS 1.3.  Then, the server requests a certificate
      from the client (via the certificate_request message)

Internet-Draft   IEEE and ETSI Certificate Types for TLS  September 2018


4.3.  Certificate Verify

   In the case where the certificate_type is 1609Dot2, the
   CertificateVerify message is subject to the following constraints:

      1) The algorithm field MUST be secp256r1 or secp384r1.

      2) The signature field contains a Canonical Octet Encoding Rules
      (COER)-encoded Ieee1609Dot2Data of type signed where:

      o payload contains an extDataHash containing the SHA-256 hash of
      the data the signature is calculated over.  This is identical to
      the data the signature is calculated over in standard TLS, which
      is reproduced below for clarity.

      o psid indicates the application activity that the certificate is
      authorizing.

      o generationTime is the current time.

      o All other optional fields in the HeaderInfo structure are
      omitted.

      o signer is of type digest.

      o The signature is calculated over the contents of the ToBeSigned
      structure as specified in [1609.2]

   The data the signature is calculated over is as follows:

      - A string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times.

      - The context string.

      - A single 0 byte which serves as the separator.

      - The content to be signed.

5.  Certificate Verification

   Verification of an IEEE 1609.2/ ETSI TS 103097 certificates or
   certificate chain is described in section 5.5.2 of [IEEE1609.2].

6.  Examples

   Some of exchanged messages examples are illustrated in Figures 2 and
   3.

6.1.  TLS Server and TLS Client use the 1609Dot2 Certificate

   This section shows an example where the TLS Client as well as the TLS
   Server use the IEEE 1609.2 certificate.  In consequence, both the
   server and the client populate the client_certificate_type and the
   server_certificate_type with extension IEEE 1609.2 certificates as
   mentioned in figure 2.

6.2.  TLS Server uses the IEEE 1609.2 certificate and TLS Client uses
      the X 509 certificate

   This example shows the TLS authentication, where the TLS Client
   populates the server_certificate_type extension with the X509
   certificate and Raw Public Key type as presented in figure 3.  The
   client indicates its ability to receive and to validate an X509
   certificate from the server.  The server chooses the X509 certificate
   to make its authentication with the Client.

7.  Security Considerations

   This section provides an overview of the basic security
   considerations which need to be taken into account before
   implementing the necessary security mechanisms.  The security
   considerations described throughout [RFC8446] and [RFC5246] apply
   here as well.

   For security considerations in a vehicular environment, the minimal
   use of any TLS extensions is recommended such as :

      The "client_certificate_type" [IANA value 19] extension who's
      purpose was previously described in [RFC7250].

      The "server_certificate_type" [IANA value 20] extension who's
      purpose was previously described in [RFC7250].

      The "SessionTicket" [IANA value 35] extension for session
      resumption.

      In addition, servers SHOULD not support renegotiation [RFC5746]
      which presented Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) type attacks over the
      past years for TLS 1.2.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   For privacy considerations in a vehicular environment the use of EEE
   1609.2/ETSI TS 103097 certificate is recommended for many reasons:

Internet-Draft   IEEE and ETSI Certificate Types for TLS  September 2018


      In order to address the risk of a personal data leakage, messages
      exchanged for V2V communications are signed using IEEE 1609.2/ETSI
      TS 103097 pseudonym certificates

      The purpose of these certificates is to provide privacy relying on
      geographical and/or temporal validity criteria, and minimizing the
      exchange of private data

9.  IANA Considerations

   Existing IANA references have not been updated yet to point to this
   document.

   IANA is asked to register a new value in the "TLS Certificate Types"
   registry of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions [TLS-
   Certificate-Types-Registry], as follows:
